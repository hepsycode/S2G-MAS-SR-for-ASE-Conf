Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual representations of physical entities, systems, or processes, used to simulate, predict, and optimize performance. The integration of MDE with DTs has been a growing area of interest in academic research, particularly in the context of automation techniques.\n\n#### Bibliometric Analysis (RQ0)\n**RQ0.1: Publication Years**\nThe peer-reviewed literature documenting the application of MDE to DTs spans several years, with a noticeable increase in publications in the last decade. This trend reflects the growing interest and advancements in both MDE and DT technologies.\n\n**RQ0.2: Publication Venues**\nResearch on MDE applications to DTs is published across a variety of venues, including journals, conferences, and workshops. Key venues include IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Journal of Systems and Software, and proceedings from conferences such as the International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS).\n\n#### Automation Techniques in Digital Twins (RQ1)\n**RQ1.1: Frequency of Automation Techniques**\nAutomation techniques are frequently applied in the context of DTs, with techniques such as machine learning, simulation, and real-time data processing being prominent. The frequency of application varies, with some techniques being more prevalent due to their effectiveness in specific scenarios.\n\n**RQ1.2: Modeling and Software Artifacts**\nAutomation techniques utilize a range of modeling artifacts, including UML diagrams, SysML models, and domain-specific languages (DSLs). Software artifacts often include simulation tools, data analytics platforms, and integration frameworks that facilitate the interaction between the physical and digital components.\n\n**RQ1.3: Input and Output Artifacts**\nCommon combinations of input and output artifacts in automation techniques include sensor data as input and predictive models or optimization results as output. These combinations are crucial for enabling real-time decision-making and system optimization.\n\n**RQ1.4: Research Types**\nThe studies applying these automation techniques are diverse, encompassing empirical research, case studies, and theoretical explorations. Empirical studies often focus on validating the effectiveness of automation techniques in real-world scenarios.\n\n#### Types of Digital Twins (RQ2)\n**RQ2.1: Types and Lifecycle Phases**\nAutomation techniques are applied to various types of DTs, including product twins, process twins, and system twins. These techniques are employed across different stages of the system lifecycle, from design and development to operation and maintenance.\n\n**RQ2.2: Variation Across Digital Twin Types**\nThe application of automation techniques varies depending on the type of DT. For instance, product twins may focus more on design optimization, while process twins emphasize operational efficiency.\n\n#### Domain Applications (RQ3)\n**RQ3.1: Domains of Application**\nAutomation techniques are applied to DTs across multiple domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. Each domain leverages DTs to address specific challenges, such as predictive maintenance in manufacturing or patient monitoring in healthcare.\n\n**RQ3.2: Variation Across Domains**\nThe application of automation techniques varies significantly across domains. In manufacturing, techniques may focus on process optimization, while in healthcare, the emphasis might be on real-time monitoring and diagnostics.\n\n**RQ3.3: Variation in Digital Twin Types Across Domains**\nDifferent domains may prioritize different types of DTs. For example, the automotive industry might focus on system twins for vehicle performance, whereas the healthcare sector might prioritize patient twins for personalized medicine.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe integration of MDE with DTs represents a significant advancement in the field of digital transformation. The bibliometric analysis highlights the growing body of research, while the exploration of automation techniques and their applications across various domains underscores the versatility and potential of DTs in enhancing system performance and decision-making. As the field continues to evolve, further research will likely focus on refining these techniques and expanding their applicability across new and emerging domains."
