Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual representations of physical entities, systems, or processes, used to simulate, predict, and optimize performance. The integration of MDE with DTs has been a growing area of interest in academic research, particularly in the context of automation techniques.\n\n#### Bibliometric Analysis of Literature (RQ0)\n**RQ0.1: Publication Years**\nThe peer-reviewed literature documenting applications of MDE to DTs spans several years, with a noticeable increase in publications in the last decade. This trend reflects the growing interest and advancements in both MDE and DT technologies.\n\n**RQ0.2: Publication Venues**\nResearch on MDE applications to DTs is published across a variety of venues, including journals, conferences, and workshops. Key venues include IEEE Transactions, ACM conferences, and specialized workshops on software engineering and systems modeling.\n\n#### Automation Techniques in Digital Twins (RQ1)\n**RQ1.1: Frequency of Automation Techniques**\nAutomation techniques are frequently applied in the context of DTs, with varying degrees of adoption. Techniques such as model transformation, code generation, and simulation are commonly used to enhance the functionality and efficiency of DTs.\n\n**RQ1.2: Modeling and Software Artifacts**\nThe automation techniques utilize a range of modeling artifacts, including UML diagrams, SysML models, and domain-specific languages (DSLs). Software artifacts often include simulation tools, data analytics platforms, and integration frameworks.\n\n**RQ1.3: Input and Output Artifacts Combinations**\nCommon combinations of input and output artifacts involve using system models as inputs to generate executable code or simulation scenarios as outputs. This process facilitates the seamless transition from design to implementation.\n\n**RQ1.4: Research Types**\nStudies applying these automation techniques are predominantly empirical, involving case studies and experimental validations. There is also a significant portion of theoretical research focusing on the development of new methodologies and frameworks.\n\n#### Types of Digital Twins and Automation Techniques (RQ2)\n**RQ2.1: Types and Lifecycle Phases**\nAutomation techniques are applied to various types of DTs, including product twins, process twins, and system twins. These techniques are employed across different stages of the system lifecycle, from design and development to deployment and maintenance.\n\n**RQ2.2: Variation Across Digital Twin Types**\nThe application of automation techniques varies depending on the type of DT. For instance, product twins often leverage simulation and optimization techniques, while process twins may focus on real-time data integration and analytics.\n\n#### Domain Applications of Digital Twins (RQ3)\n**RQ3.1: Domains of Application**\nDTs with automation techniques are applied across multiple domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. Each domain leverages DTs to address specific challenges, such as predictive maintenance in manufacturing or patient monitoring in healthcare.\n\n**RQ3.2: Variation Across Domains**\nThe application of automation techniques varies significantly across domains. In manufacturing, techniques like real-time monitoring and predictive analytics are prevalent, whereas in healthcare, the focus might be on data integration and patient-specific simulations.\n\n**RQ3.3: Variation in Digital Twin Types Across Domains**\nDifferent domains prioritize different types of DTs. For example, the automotive industry may focus on system twins for vehicle dynamics, while the healthcare sector might prioritize patient-specific twins for personalized medicine.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe integration of MDE with DTs is a dynamic and evolving field, with significant research dedicated to exploring automation techniques. The bibliometric analysis reveals a growing body of literature, while the application of these techniques spans various domains and types of DTs. This synthesis highlights the potential of MDE to enhance the capabilities of DTs, offering insights into future research directions and practical applications."
