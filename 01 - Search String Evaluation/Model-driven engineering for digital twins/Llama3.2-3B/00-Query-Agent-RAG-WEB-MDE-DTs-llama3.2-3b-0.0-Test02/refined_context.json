This synthesis aims to provide a detailed overview of the bibliometric landscape, the application of automation techniques, and the domain-specific implementations of MDE in DTs, based on peer-reviewed literature indexed in Scopus.\n\n#### RQ0: Bibliometric Key Facts\n**RQ0.1: Publication Years**\nThe literature on MDE applications to DTs has seen a progressive increase in publications over recent years, reflecting the growing interest and advancements in this field. The majority of the studies have been published in the last decade, with a notable surge in the past five years, indicating a trend towards more sophisticated and integrated approaches.\n\n**RQ0.2: Publication Venues**\nResearch on this topic is predominantly published in high-impact journals and conferences related to software engineering, systems engineering, and industrial applications. Key venues include the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, the Journal of Systems and Software, and proceedings from conferences such as the International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS).\n\n#### RQ1: Automation Techniques in Digital Twins\n**RQ1.1: Frequency of Automation Techniques**\nAutomation techniques are frequently applied in DTs to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Techniques such as machine learning, simulation-based optimization, and automated code generation are commonly employed. The frequency of these applications varies, with machine learning being the most prevalent due to its adaptability and predictive capabilities.\n\n**RQ1.2: Modeling and Software Artifacts**\nThe automation techniques utilize a variety of modeling artifacts, including UML diagrams, SysML models, and domain-specific languages (DSLs). Software artifacts often include simulation tools, integrated development environments (IDEs), and middleware platforms that facilitate the seamless integration of DTs with physical systems.\n\n**RQ1.3: Input and Output Artifacts Combinations**\nCommon combinations of input and output artifacts involve the use of sensor data and real-time analytics as inputs, with outputs typically being predictive models, performance dashboards, and control commands for physical systems.\n\n**RQ1.4: Research Types**\nThe studies predominantly fall into empirical research, case studies, and experimental validations, with a focus on demonstrating the practical applicability and benefits of automation techniques in real-world scenarios.\n\n#### RQ2: Types of Digital Twins\n**RQ2.1: Types and Lifecycle Phases**\nAutomation techniques are applied across various types of DTs, including product twins, process twins, and system twins. These techniques are integrated at different stages of the System Lifecycle Process (SLCP) and the Technology Lifecycle Process (TLCP), from design and development to deployment and maintenance.\n\n**RQ2.2: Variation Across Digital Twin Types**\nThe application of automation techniques varies significantly across different DT types. For instance, product twins often leverage simulation and optimization techniques during the design phase, while process twins may utilize real-time data analytics for operational efficiency.\n\n#### RQ3: Domain-Specific Applications\n**RQ3.1: Domains of Application**\nAutomation techniques in DTs are applied across diverse domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, automotive, and smart cities. Each domain leverages DTs to address specific challenges, such as predictive maintenance in manufacturing or patient monitoring in healthcare.\n\n**RQ3.2: Variation by Domain**\nThe application of automation techniques varies by domain, with manufacturing focusing on process optimization and healthcare emphasizing data-driven decision-making. The choice of techniques is influenced by domain-specific requirements and constraints.\n\n**RQ3.3: Variation in Digital Twin Types by Domain**\nDifferent domains prioritize different types of DTs. For example, manufacturing often employs process twins for operational efficiency, while the automotive industry may focus on product twins for design and testing.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe integration of MDE with DTs is a rapidly evolving field, characterized by diverse applications and significant potential for innovation. The bibliometric analysis highlights the growing body of research, while the exploration of automation techniques and domain-specific applications underscores the versatility and impact of DTs across various industries. This synthesis provides a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and future directions for research and development in this dynamic area."
