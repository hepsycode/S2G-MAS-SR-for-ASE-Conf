Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual representations of physical entities, systems, or processes, used to simulate, predict, and optimize performance. The integration of MDE with DTs has been a growing area of interest in academic research, particularly in the context of automation techniques.\n\n#### Bibliometric Analysis (RQ0)\n**RQ0.1: Publication Years**\nThe peer-reviewed literature documenting applications of MDE to DTs spans several years, with a noticeable increase in publications in the last decade. This trend reflects the growing interest and advancements in both MDE and DT technologies.\n\n**RQ0.2: Publication Venues**\nResearch on MDE applications to DTs is published across a variety of venues, including journals, conferences, and workshops. Key venues include IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Journal of Systems and Software, and the International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS).\n\n#### Automation Techniques in Digital Twins (RQ1)\n**RQ1.1: Frequency of Automation Techniques**\nAutomation techniques are frequently applied in the context of DTs, with techniques such as model transformation, code generation, and simulation being the most common. These techniques are essential for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of DTs.\n\n**RQ1.2: Modeling and Software Artifacts**\nThe automation techniques utilize various modeling artifacts, such as UML diagrams and SysML models, and software artifacts, including simulation tools and code generators. These artifacts facilitate the creation and management of DTs.\n\n**RQ1.3: Input and Output Artifacts Combinations**\nCommon combinations of input and output artifacts include the use of system models as inputs to generate executable code or simulation models as outputs. These combinations are crucial for the seamless integration of DTs with physical systems.\n\n**RQ1.4: Research Types**\nThe studies applying these automation techniques are predominantly empirical, focusing on case studies and experiments. There is also a significant portion of theoretical research that explores new methodologies and frameworks.\n\n#### Types of Digital Twins (RQ2)\n**RQ2.1: Types and Lifecycle Phases**\nAutomation techniques are applied to various types of DTs, including product, process, and system twins. These techniques are employed across different stages of the system lifecycle, from design and development to operation and maintenance.\n\n**RQ2.2: Variation Across Digital Twin Types**\nThe application of automation techniques varies depending on the type of DT. For instance, product twins often utilize simulation and optimization techniques, while process twins may focus on real-time data integration and analysis.\n\n#### Domain Applications (RQ3)\n**RQ3.1: Domains of Application**\nAutomation techniques for DTs are applied across multiple domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. Each domain leverages DTs to address specific challenges, such as predictive maintenance in manufacturing or patient monitoring in healthcare.\n\n**RQ3.2: Variation Across Domains**\nThe application of automation techniques varies significantly across domains. In manufacturing, there is a strong emphasis on process optimization and predictive analytics, whereas in healthcare, the focus is on real-time monitoring and decision support.\n\n**RQ3.3: Variation in Digital Twin Types Across Domains**\nDifferent domains utilize different types of DTs. For example, the automotive industry often employs system twins for vehicle testing and validation, while the aerospace sector uses product twins for design and simulation.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe integration of MDE with DTs is a dynamic and evolving field, with significant research dedicated to exploring automation techniques. The bibliometric analysis highlights the growing interest and diverse applications across various domains. As the field progresses, further research is expected to enhance the capabilities and applications of DTs, driven by advancements in MDE and automation technologies."
