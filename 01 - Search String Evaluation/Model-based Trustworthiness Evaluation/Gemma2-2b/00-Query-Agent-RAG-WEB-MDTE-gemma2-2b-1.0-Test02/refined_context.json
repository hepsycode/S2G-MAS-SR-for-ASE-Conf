This involves identifying publication trends, supporting tools, and applications from the perspective of researchers and practitioners. The study is structured around the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach, focusing on specific research questions to guide the investigation.\n\n#### Research Goals and Questions\nThe primary purpose of this research is to identify, classify, and evaluate the current state of model-based evaluation methods for trustworthiness in ACPS. The research questions (RQs) are designed to uncover various dimensions of this field:\n\n- **RQ1:** What are the main research trends in the model-based evaluation of ACPS's trustworthiness?\n- **RQ2:** Which aspects and attributes of trustworthiness are addressed by current studies?\n- **RQ3:** What are the main modeling languages used for evaluating trustworthiness in ACPS?\n- **RQ4:** What model-based software tools have been used to evaluate trustworthiness in ACPS?\n\n#### Methodology\nThe study utilizes the Scopus database to gather relevant literature, focusing on publications from the year 2006 onwards. This timeframe ensures the inclusion of contemporary research developments and trends.\n\n#### Key Findings from Retrieved Documents\n\n1. **Research Trends (RQ1):**\n   - The literature indicates a growing interest in the integration of model-based approaches to enhance the trustworthiness of ACPS. Recent trends highlight the shift towards more sophisticated models that incorporate real-time data analytics and machine learning to predict and mitigate potential system failures.\n\n2. **Trustworthiness Aspects (RQ2):**\n   - Current studies address various aspects of trustworthiness, including reliability, security, and safety. There is a significant focus on developing metrics and frameworks that can quantitatively assess these attributes, ensuring that ACPS can operate autonomously without compromising on performance or safety.\n\n3. **Modeling Languages (RQ3):**\n   - The research identifies several modeling languages that are prevalent in the evaluation of ACPS trustworthiness. These include UML (Unified Modeling Language), SysML (Systems Modeling Language), and domain-specific languages tailored for cyber-physical systems. These languages facilitate the creation of detailed models that can simulate and analyze system behavior under different conditions.\n\n4. **Software Tools (RQ4):**\n   - Various model-based software tools are employed to evaluate trustworthiness in ACPS. Tools such as MATLAB/Simulink, Modelica, and specialized simulation platforms are frequently used to model complex interactions within ACPS and assess their trustworthiness through rigorous testing and validation processes.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe synthesis of information from the retrieved documents provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of model-based evaluation for trustworthiness in ACPS. The findings underscore the importance of adopting advanced modeling techniques and tools to ensure that these systems can be trusted to perform critical functions autonomously. Future research should continue to explore innovative approaches and technologies that can further enhance the reliability and safety of ACPS.\n\n#### Metadata for Traceability\n- **Database:** Scopus\n- **Publication Year:** Post-2006\n- **Viewpoint:** Researchers and Practitioners\n- **Focus:** Model-based evaluation, Trustworthiness, Cyber-Physical Production Systems\n\nThis refined context serves as a foundation for further exploration and development in the field, providing valuable insights for both academic researchers and industry practitioners."
